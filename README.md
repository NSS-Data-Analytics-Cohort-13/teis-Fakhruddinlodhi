## TEIS Outcomes Calculation

[The Tennessee Early Intervention System (TEIS)](https://www.tn.gov/disability-and-aging/disability-aging-programs/teis.html) is a program program that offers therapy and other services to families of infants and young children with developmental delays or disabilities. 

TEIS is required to report outcomes data annually on children who exited early intervention services and received a minimum of 6 months of service. This is based on the first (entrance) assessment and last (exit) assessment. For the 2023-24 data, every exit assessment used the BDI-3, but there were three possible entrance assessments.

Your first objective in this project is to compare two sets of business rules for calculating Early Childhood Outcome (ECO). For more information on the sets of business rules, see the "TEIS Data Project" document. 

You can see the calculations for the original business rules in the ECO Data spreadsheet. Your first objective is to redo the calculations for children with either the BDI-2 or BDI-3 as the entrance assessment. See the new business rules in the TEIS Data Project document.

Your second objective is to investigate children who did not improve functioning (progress category a) and report demographic qualities of these children, including
* Point of Entry office (POE)
    - See the TEIS Acronyms and Terms document for the full for each POE
* Length of time in services
* Length between assessment and exit
* Length between entrance and exit assessments
* Difference between extrance and exit assessment instruments
* Age at assessment/exit
